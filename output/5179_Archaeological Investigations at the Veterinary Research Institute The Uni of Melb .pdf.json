The excavation director \\nwas Barry Green; the supervisor was Brian Shanahan; site assistants were Laura Campbell and Michael \\nLever. \\n\\n3.1 \\n\\nAims \\n\\nThe aim of the investigation is to understand the nature, location and extent of archaeological material \\nat the VRI site. This is done firstly through the careful excavation of the site itself but then through \\nanalysis  of  what  has  been  found  and  answering  questions  in  the  Research  Design.  The  Research \\nDesign\u2019s goal is to formulate ways to interrogate the datasets generated by the excavation to better \\nunderstand  the  phases of activity  at  the  site. The Research Design  has  three  sections, Descriptive, \\nAnalytical and Interpretive. \\n\\n3.1.1 \\n\\nDescriptive' metadata={'source': '/home/unimelb.edu.au/hamzeie/Desktop/hv_hackathon/data/5179_Archaeological Investigations at the Veterinary Research Institute The Uni of Melb .pdf'}",
